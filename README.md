# MediaWiki Converter

This is a converter from MediaWiki pages to a static simplified web side that is suitable for hosting on GitHub pages.

The test environment for this converter is the Borium web site that is maintained locally using Bitnami Mediawiki 1.37.1-0. Other versions may not work as well, and I don't intend to upgrade Mediawiki any time soon, so this environment will be stable enough for development.
